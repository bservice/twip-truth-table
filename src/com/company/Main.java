        Going to do comments because I can't do this and my partner's code makes no sense.

        I would take the input the user has given and take the two things to compare. Then
        I would see if how they were being compared (&& or ||) and then print out T's amd F's
        for when they are true or false and then print to the right of them what the final result
        would be.

        Example:
        Input: X || Y

        X    Y    Result
        T    T    T
        T    F    T
        F    T    T
        F    F    F

        Hope this is good enough because I can't put this in code
